## **IG_TR_Cregions.gff3**
   - Contains Ig/TCR constant region annotations on genome assembly ASM1176430v1.1 as described by Walsh et al (2023)
## **IG_TR_VDJregions.gff3**
   - Contains Ig/TCR variable, diversity, and joining region annotations on genome assembly ASM1176430v1.1 as described by Walsh et. al (2023)
## **IG_TR_10FerretAssemblies.gff3**
- Contains Walsh et. al (2023) Ig/TCR constant region annotations on the following ferret genome assemblies: ASM985922v1, M1713, ASM985917v1, ASM985921v1, ASM985924v1, ASM985926v1, ASM985923v1, ASM1036756v1, ASM1036757v1, and ASM985912v1.
- Quality of previously published draft genome assemblies and allelic variation between animals were not assessed.
- Annotations that had low mapping quality and overlapped in alignment with another C region were <ins>**excluded**</ins> from the GFF3 file.
   -   IGLC1-1: ASM1036757v1, ASM1036756v1, M1713, ASM985921v1
   -   IGLC6-1: ASM985922v1, ASM985923v1
- Annotations that had high mapping quality but aligned 1) further away from the locus or 2) to another contig suggest potential assembly errors.

   -   IGLC2-1: ASM985926v1, ASM985924v1, ASM985923v1, ASM985922v1
   -   IGLC4-1: M1713
   -   IGLC6-1: ASM1036756v1, ASM985917v1, ASM985912v1

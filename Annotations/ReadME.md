## **IG_TR_10FerretAssemblies.gff3**
- Contains Walsh et. al (2023) Ig/TCR constant region annotations on the following ferret genome assemblies: ASM985912v1, ASM985917v1, ASM985921v1, ASM985922v1, ASM985923v1, ASM985924v1, ASM985926v1, M1713, ASM1036756v1, and ASM1036757v1.
- The GFF3 file contains only exon annotations, ranging from the 5' splice site to the 3' UTR, and does not provide frame information.
- Quality of previously published draft genome assemblies and allelic variation between animals were not assessed.
- Annotations that had low mapping quality and overlapped in alignment with another C region were <ins>**excluded**</ins> from the GFF3 file.

   -   IGLC6*01: ASM985921v1,ASM985926v1
- Annotations that had high mapping quality but aligned to another contig suggest potential assembly errors.

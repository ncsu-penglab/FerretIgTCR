# FerretIgTCR

## Annotations folder
Annotated ferret Ig/TCR constant, variable, diversity, and joining regions described in Walsh et. al
are stored as **IG_TR_Cregions.gff3** and **IG_TR_VDJregions.gff3** respectively.
Constant regions described in Walsh et. al were annotated in the other 10 ferret reference genome
assemblies and are stored as **IG_TR_10FerretAssemblies.gff3**.

## IgBLAST folder 
The IgBLAST folder contains the IgBLAST database files used for the ferret constant, variable, diversity,
and joining region annotations.

### IMGT_reference_sequences subfolder
Combined IMGT Ig/TCR constant, variable, diversity, and joining germline sequences from ferret, dog, cat, and horse 
used to construct the IgBLAST database are stored as fasta files.

## scripts folder
Custom Python and R scripts for V gene indentification and filtering are stored as 
**Vgene_RSS_identification_workflow.py** and **1_search.R** respectively.

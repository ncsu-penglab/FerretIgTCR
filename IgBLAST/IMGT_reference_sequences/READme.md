# IMGT/Gene-db 
The reference fasta files contain germiline sequences for variable and constant gene segemnts for dog, cat, and horse.
## `For each species do the following:`
1) Obtain **in-frame** germline allele sequences. This includes all V, D, J, and C alleles
   ```
   A) Keep functionality and molecular component to **any**
   B) Save **.fasta** file
   ```
2) Obtain V gene allele annotations
   ```
   A) Select gene type `variable`
   B) Keep functionality and molecular component to `any`
   C) Save `.fasta` file
   ```
3) Obtain J gene allele annotations
   ```
   A) Select gene type `joining`
   B) Keep functionality and molecular component to `any`
   C) Save `.fasta` file
   ```

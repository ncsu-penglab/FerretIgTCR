# IMGT/Gene-DB  
The reference fasta files contain germline variable and constant gene segment sequences for dog, cat, and horse.
## For each species do the following:
1) Obtain **in-frame** germline allele sequences. This includes all V, D, J, and C alleles
   ```
   A) Keep functionality and molecular component to 'any'
   B) Save '.fasta' file
   ```
2) Obtain V gene allele annotations
   ```
   A) Select gene type 'variable'
   B) Keep functionality and molecular component to 'any'
   C) Save '.fasta' file
   ```
3) Obtain J gene allele annotations
   ```
   A) Select gene type 'joining'
   B) Keep functionality and molecular component to 'any'
   C) Save '.fasta' file
   ```
